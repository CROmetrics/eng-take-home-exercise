After the Devbox is setup, CodeSandbox should automatically start the dev server, and inform you `Port 1234 has been opened` with the option to "Open Preview". Click "Open Preview" to view the project hosted on the dev server.

If the dev server is not automatically started by CodeSandbox, you can start it manually by running `npm run start` in the terminal and then clicking "Open Preview" once the server has been started.

## Getting Started

Running the dev server will locally host `index.html` which contains a list of nine problems you need to solve. For each problem, you will need to code your solution in the corresponding "solution" file found in `src/solutions`.

E.g., For "Problem #1" you will create your solution in `src/solution/solution1.ts`.

**Do not add or change _ANY_ code in files outside of the `solutions/` diretory in order to make your code work**

If you believe there is an error or something is broken, please reach out to your hiring manager at Cro Metrics to let them know the issue you are running into. They will have one of our Engineers take a look and fix it if necessary.

## Submitting your work

1. Click "Share" ![CodeSandbox Share Button](images/share.png)
